#Slack Clone:

This Project is just how it sounds. It has group chat functionality like Slack. 
Some of the features include: Login with Facebook or Google, and a chatbot that can do some cool things. 
A few cool highlights the bot can do is, send text art to other users, send SMS messages to other people, you can also tell it to say things to the room. 
Technologies used: Python Flask, Reactjs, Socketio, Postgres, and Twilio API.


#My Thoughts
### The theme i wanted to be light and elegant. There's a backgound picture of a cut carrots on a cutting board that I bleached out. 
###    Ontop of that is a screen where the text shows up. I put some cool things in which are mario art and ther things. Just use the help to see what the key words are. 
### The probles are more UX things that I have found. The screen could move down and not have to manullay be done. Also, the text box is really small and basic.
### I would say it needs a lot of UI work, but in 2 weeks, I'm happy with it.
### I think one of the big things that I would improve is the bot, I'm not going to say how because i'm going to do it for part 2. 
###  The other thing is that the code really needs to be cleaned up. It's realy messy, but I'm just glad I finished the assignment.



Some starter code for React on Flask.

## Upgrade Node version to 6

```$ nvm install 6```

## Installing Webpack

```$ npm install -g webpack```

## Installing `npm` dependencies from `package.json`

```$ npm install```

## Compiling Javascript using Webpack

```$ webpack --watch```

(The program should not stop running. Leave it running.)

## Edit a JS file

Make a change to `scripts/Content.js`. Webpack should detect the change and 
print a bunch of stuff.

**Do not manually edit `static/script.js`!!**

## Add new JS files

Stuff that is added to `scripts/` and referenced somewhere else will 
automatically be packaged into `static/script.js`.

## Running the web server

Click on the green button on `app.py`, or open up a new terminal and type:

```$ python app.py```
