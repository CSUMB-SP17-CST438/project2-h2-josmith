#My Thoughts
### The theme i wanted to be light and elegant. There's a backgound picture of a cut carrots on a cutting board that I bleached out. 
###    Ontop of that is a screen where the text shows up. I put some cool things in which are mario art and ther things. Just use the help to see what the key words are. 
### The probles are more UX things that I have found. The screen could move down and not have to manullay be done. Also, the text box is really small and basic.
### I would say it needs a lot of UI work, but in 2 weeks, I'm happy with it.
### I think one of the big things that I would improve is the bot, I'm not going to say how because i'm going to do it for part 2. 
###  The other thing is that the code really needs to be cleaned up. It's realy messy, but I'm just glad I finished the assignment.



Some starter code for React on Flask.

## Upgrade Node version to 6

```$ nvm install 6```

## Installing Webpack

```$ npm install -g webpack```

## Installing `npm` dependencies from `package.json`

```$ npm install```

## Compiling Javascript using Webpack

```$ webpack --watch```

(The program should not stop running. Leave it running.)

## Edit a JS file

Make a change to `scripts/Content.js`. Webpack should detect the change and 
print a bunch of stuff.

**Do not manually edit `static/script.js`!!**

## Add new JS files

Stuff that is added to `scripts/` and referenced somewhere else will 
automatically be packaged into `static/script.js`.

## Running the web server

Click on the green button on `app.py`, or open up a new terminal and type:

```$ python app.py```

## Confused?

I'll explain what all this does in a bit. For now, use it as a starter to
write some React code.
